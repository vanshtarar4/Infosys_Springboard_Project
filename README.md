# Predictive Transaction Intelligence for BFSI

## Project Overview
This project implements predictive transaction intelligence for the Banking, Financial Services, and Insurance (BFSI) sector, focusing on fraud detection and risk assessment.

## Milestone 1 Objectives
1. **Data Acquisition & Exploration**
   - Gather and understand transaction datasets
   - Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA)
   - Identify key patterns and anomalies

2. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Handle missing values and outliers
   - Feature engineering for transaction data
   - Data normalization and scaling

3. **Initial Model Development**
   - Baseline model creation
   - Feature selection and importance analysis
   - Model evaluation metrics setup
