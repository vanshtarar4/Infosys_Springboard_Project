# UI Reference Images

This directory is reserved for UI reference images that will be provided by the user.

## Purpose

Place reference images here to guide the frontend styling and layout:

- Color schemes
- Layout designs
- Component styles
- Typography references
- Spacing and sizing guides

## Usage

1. Add your reference images to this directory
2. Reference them in components if needed: `/assets/refs/your-image.png`
3. Use as a visual guide when customizing Tailwind config and component styles

## Customization Workflow

1. Review reference images
2. Extract color palette → Update `tailwind.config.ts`
3. Identify layout patterns → Update page components
4. Match typography → Update global CSS
5. Implement spacing/sizing → Adjust utility classes

The frontend is built with flexibility to match any provided design reference.
